MIT App Inventor app

The app is designed to provide a user with a navigational route to a specified location by dragging 
and dropping a way point. The app is also equipped with a step tracker to count the user's steps.


Screen 1 is the main screen where a user can generate a route from their current location to a 
specific point of their choosing. The user generates the route by clicking the “generate route” 
button. The user can also reposition the map to their current location by clicking the “pan to 
location” button. If the user wants to reset the end point, they can do so by clicking the “reset end 
point” button. The “steps” button changes to screen 2, to the tracking functionality, where the user 
can track their steps. The “how to guide” button changes to screen 3, to provides a how to guide with instructions on how to use the app.
